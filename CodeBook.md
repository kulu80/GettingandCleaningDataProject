# objective of the R code is
###Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set %.
###Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
###Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
###Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
##From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#steps followed
